                    <p>A timeless romance that follows Elizabeth Bennet, a sharp-witted young woman who initially dislikes the 
                        proud and wealthy Mr. Darcy. As misunderstandings and social expectations threaten their love, Elizabeth 
                        learns to look beyond first impressions. The novel explores themes of class, marriage, and personal growth
                         in early 19th-century England.
